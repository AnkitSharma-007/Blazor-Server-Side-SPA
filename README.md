# Blazor-Server-Side-SPA
We will create a Single Page Application (SPA) using the server-side Blazor concepts with the help of Entity Framework Core database first approach. Single-Page Applications are web applications that loads a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app.

We will create a sample Employee Record Management System and perform CRUD operations on it. We will use a form to accept the user inputs. The form will have client-side validations and contains a dropdown list, which will bind to a database table. We will also provide a filter option to the user to filter the employee records based on employee name.

We will use Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server 2017.
